# Syncp_APIs

These scripts require jq installed.
Some scripts depend on other scripts, so it's best to download all of them together.
Credentials file in all scripts is /root/DemoAccount. In case you want to use a different location/file, please change it in all scripts.
The credentials file needs to look like the following:

App Key:          "INSERT KEY HERE"

App Secret:       "INSERT SECRET HERE"

Application Token:"INSERT TOKEN HERE"
